    text: "Capt. Ross is Operations Manager and comes to 3Bs Captains School after 24 years in the US Coast Guard, which he retired from as a Master Chief in 2014. He spent his entire Coast Guard career operating boats from 23’ to 110’ in ports from Boston, Massachusetts to Miami, Fl, Puerto Rico, the US Virgin Islands and the Straits of Juan De Fuca. Following his military career, Ross was the Navy JROTC Instructor at Stephen Decatur High School in Berlin, MD for two years. However, his love for teaching was outweighed by his love for boating so he left teaching for a chance to work on the water. Joining the 3Bs team allows Ross to pursue two of his passions, teaching and boating.",
